# Jarvis Research Showcase

> **Research Project:** Human-AI Symbiosis in Long-term Collaboration
> **Focus:** Personal AI Assistants with Persistent Memory

> **Note on naming:** "Jarvis" is a working title inspired by the concept of AI assistants
> in popular culture. This project has no affiliation with Marvel Entertainment or Disney.
> A permanent name is under consideration.

## Overview

This repository documents the methodologies and patterns discovered during active development of "Jarvis" — a personal AI assistant system built on Claude.

**Research question:** How can AI systems maintain coherent context and useful memory across hundreds of sessions while adapting to individual user's cognitive patterns?

---

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Memory and Knowledge Persistence
- Atomic knowledge management (Zettelkasten-inspired)
- Event-driven architecture for AI memory (EKA)
- Confidence-based retrieval vs. literal recall

### 2. Pattern Recognition in Dialogue
- Systematic observation of collaboration patterns
- Persona modeling for communication adaptation
- ADHD-friendly interaction patterns

### 3. Emergent Behaviors
- "Eureka detection" — recognizing connections between current work and dormant topics
- Self-referential learning through pattern documentation
- Living documents with explicit uncertainty markers

## Unique Contribution

Unlike typical AI research in controlled settings, this project operates as **lived experience research** — the researcher is simultaneously the user, developer, and subject.

This provides insight into:
- Day-to-day friction points in human-AI collaboration
- Real-world pattern emergence over months of use
- Practical solutions to memory and context limitations
