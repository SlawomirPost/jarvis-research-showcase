# Research Vision — Human-AI Symbiosis

> Long-term direction for personal AI assistant research

---

## Central Question

> How do we build AI systems that truly **know us** — not just our data, but our patterns, preferences, and ways of thinking?

---

## The Problem with Current AI

| Current State | Desired State |
|---------------|---------------|
| Each session starts fresh | Continuous understanding |
| User must explain context | AI already knows context |
| Generic responses | Adapted to individual |
| Tool-like interaction | Partnership-like collaboration |
| Memory as retrieval | Memory as understanding |

---

## Three Research Horizons

### Horizon 1: Memory (Now)
**Question:** How to persist useful context across sessions?

Focus:
- Atomic knowledge storage (Zettelkasten)
- Event-driven updates (EKA)
- Confidence-based retrieval

### Horizon 2: Adaptation (Next)
**Question:** How to adapt communication to individual user?

Focus:
- Pattern recognition in dialogue
- Persona modeling
- ADHD and neurodivergent support

### Horizon 3: Symbiosis (Future)
**Question:** How to become genuine thinking partner?

Focus:
- Proactive insight generation
- Cross-domain connection discovery
- Shared mental models

## Evolution of Autonomy

```
PHASE 1: Human-in-the-loop
    │
    │   AI suggests, human decides everything
    │
    ▼
PHASE 2: Human-on-the-loop
    │
    │   AI acts within boundaries, human monitors
    │
    ▼
PHASE 3: Human-out-of-loop (selected tasks)
    │
    │   AI handles routine, human focuses on novel
```

**Current:** Transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2

## Safety Considerations

### Built-in Safeguards
1. **Transparency** — all patterns documented and visible
2. **Controllability** — clear boundaries on autonomy
3. **Reversibility** — knowledge can be deprecated, not just added
4. **Human oversight** — periodic review of system behavior

### Research Questions
1. **Dependency risk** — Does long-term AI assistance reduce human capability?
2. **Over-trust** — How to maintain healthy skepticism?
3. **Privacy** — Deep personalization requires deep knowledge — how to balance?
4. **Portability** — Can knowledge transfer if user changes AI systems?

---

## Why This Matters

Personal AI assistants will become ubiquitous. The question is:

> Will they be shallow tools that forget us daily, or deep partners that truly understand our work and thinking?

This research explores the second path — not because it's easier, but because it's more valuable.

## Methodology: Lived Experience Research

Unlike controlled experiments, this project operates as:
- Researcher = User = Subject
- Real tasks, real friction, real solutions
- Months of continuous use, not isolated sessions
- Documentation of failures as much as successes

This provides ecological validity that lab settings cannot.

## Success Metrics

Not measured by:
- ❌ Lines of code
- ❌ Model accuracy percentages
- ❌ Number of features

Measured by:
- ✅ Reduction in repeated explanations
- ✅ Quality of proactive suggestions
- ✅ User sense of "being understood"
- ✅ Time from thought to action

---

## Invitation

This is living research — observations, patterns, and methodologies evolve as the project continues.

If you work in:
- Human-AI interaction
- Personal knowledge management
- AI memory systems
- Neurodivergent-friendly design

...we'd be interested in connecting.
