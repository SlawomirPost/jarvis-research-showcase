| 25 Jan | External Researcher Access application drafted |
| 25 Jan | jarvis-research-showcase repository created |
| 26 Jan | Session 029: "Node Zero" — 11 persistent threads born |
| 27 Jan | Session 030: KS-AOW service workspace |
| 28-29 Jan | Session 031: Major consolidation (12 compressions, 14 new zettels) |
| 29 Jan | Jobs To Be Done framework applied |

**Key achievement:** Core methodologies formalized and documented.
