# Anthropic Claude Credits Application — Jarvis Project

> **Applicant:** Sławomir Post
> **Project:** Jarvis — Personal AI Concierge with Linguistic OS
> **Requested:** $1,000 Claude API credits
> **Date:** February 2026

## 1. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Jarvis** is a research-driven Living Lab exploring how conversational AI can serve as a persistent knowledge partner with "word agency" — the ability to execute complex workflows through natural language.

**Key Innovation: Linguistic OS**

A foundational layer (Layer -1) where words build workflows, including conditionals and loops. Inspired by Roman law verbal formalism: "Say what you'll do — if it sounds right, do it."

**Validation:** 17 days of daily use, 173 atomic knowledge notes, 50+ tracked sessions with 100% context survival through compressions.

---

## 2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. **Can verbal formalism serve as an executable layer for AI workflows?**
   - Hypothesis: LLMs trained on truthful intent language can self-audit through verbalization
   - Early evidence: P-META-005 (verbalization before action) reduces errors

2. **Can Total Memory solve the context loss problem?**
   - Hypothesis: CHECKPOINT + DELTA model enables linear access to conversation history
   - Early evidence: SESSION_LOGS with per-compression chunks, 100% session survival

3. **Can Progressive Enrichment create compound returns?**
   - Hypothesis: Every system use improves it for future sessions
   - Early evidence: 47+ procedures evolved through actual use

## 3. WHAT WE'VE BUILT (without API credits)

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Linguistic OS** | Verbal formalism layer (Layer -1) | Concept validated |
| **Total Memory** | SESSION_LOGS + FROZEN_SESSIONS | Working |
| **Session Freeze** | 3-layer persistence model | Working |
| **EKA** | Confidence-weighted knowledge architecture | Working |
| **47+ Procedures** | Formalized operations with versioning | Deployed |
| **173 Zettels** | Atomic knowledge with explicit links | Growing |
| **12 Architectural Concepts** | Documented in JARVIS_CORE | Documented |

## 4. WHAT API CREDITS WOULD ENABLE

### Research Track

| Research | Description | Credits Needed |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Extended Session Testing** | Multi-day sessions with heavy context | ~$300 |
| **Multi-Agent Experiments** | jarvis-jpm-meta spawning specialized agents | ~$200 |
| **Total Memory Stress Test** | Large-scale history navigation | ~$200 |
| **Linguistic OS Formalization** | Testing verbal workflow patterns | ~$200 |
| **Buffer** | Unexpected research needs | ~$100 |

### Outputs

1. **Methodology documentation** (CC-BY-4.0, public)
   - Linguistic OS specification
   - Total Memory implementation guide
   - Progressive Enrichment patterns

2. **Case studies** showing workflow-from-words in action

3. **Open-source tools** (if developed):
   - Session logs generator
   - CHECKPOINT navigation

## 5. WHY ANTHROPIC

1. **Claude is the core** — Jarvis is built entirely on Claude Code CLI
2. **Alignment with Anthropic values** — Linguistic Safeguards = AI that says what it will do
3. **Research contribution** — Findings applicable to Claude-based applications

---

## 6. DIFFERENTIATORS

| Other AI Assistants | Jarvis |
|---------------------|--------|
| Forget after session | Total Memory — linear history access |
| Execute commands | Word Agency — words create workflows |
| Generic | Personalized concierge with context |
| Tool | Cognitive partner |

**Unique approach:** Verbal formalism as executable layer (Linguistic OS).

---

## 7. TEAM

**Solo founder** with:
- PRINCE2 Agile certification
- NLP Master Practitioner
- 17 days of intensive development with Claude

**Limitation:** Non-programmer — building through conversation, not code.

**Strength:** User perspective — if it works for non-technical users, it's truly accessible.

---

## 8. TIMELINE

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| **Feb 2026** | Linguistic OS formalization, extended session tests |
| **Mar 2026** | Multi-Agent experiments, Total Memory stress tests |
| **Apr 2026** | Documentation completion, public methodology release |
