## ✅ Done

### 1. Total Memory — 100% Session Survival
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 30 Jan 2026
Context compression no longer loses information. Sessions survive multiple compressions with full knowledge retention.

### 2. Linguistic OS — Meta-dispatcher v4.8
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 31 Jan 2026
Verbal formalism layer that translates natural language to procedures. Inspired by Roman law contracts.

### 3. Session Persistence (FROZEN_SESSIONS)
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 19 Jan 2026
Sessions can be frozen and resumed with full context. 100% survival rate across 50+ tracked sessions.

### 4. Zettelkasten Integration
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 19 Jan 2026
Atomic knowledge management with 170+ notes. Confidence levels (A/B/C/D) for knowledge quality tracking.

### 5. EKA Proof of Concept
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 23 Jan 2026
Event-Knowledge Architecture schema designed. Test queries validated. Ready for Supabase implementation.

### 6. Mermaid Diagrams Skill
**Status:** Done | **Date:** 24 Jan 2026
Text-based diagram generation. 20x cheaper than visual tools (~100 tokens vs ~2000).

## 🔬 Research

### 7. Attention Stream Architecture
**Status:** Research | **Priority:** Medium
Tracking Principal's focus across terminals instead of sessions. New dimension for thread/session management.

### 8. Verbalization Lab (SVI Benchmark)
**Status:** Research | **Priority:** High
Empirical study of verbalization effectiveness. Hypothesis: Self-Verbalized Intent increases error detection from ~60% to ~95%+.

### 9. Parallel Work Model
**Status:** Research | **Priority:** Medium
Human thinks creatively + Jarvis executes routine tasks = synergy. Foundation for monetization value proposition.

### 10. Living Concept Documents
**Status:** Research | **Priority:** Low
Documents that evolve with the project. Self-updating based on new knowledge.
